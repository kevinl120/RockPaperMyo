#IMPORTANT!!! READ ME!!! ACTUALLY!!!

####READ THIS BEFORE EDITING PROGRAM!
```
YES, READ THIS!!!

At YCHacks, we used SpriteBuilder 1.2 Beta before it officially came out so we could use CCEffects in our game. SpriteBuilder 1.2 is now officially out, and MAKE SURE YOU UPDATE TO THAT VERSION! DO NOT EDIT WITH SPRITEBUILDER 1.2 BETA!

To check, click SpriteBuilder>About SpriteBuilder. A window should pop up saying your version and giving some other information. If it says "Version: 1.2.0-beta", that version is now useless. DO NOT USE IT! Go to the version of spritebuilder that is non-beta and update it. You may also have to update cocos-2d, but SpriteBuilder should take care of that for you.

As of 9/13/2014: Check your version, it should say "Version: 1.2.1".
